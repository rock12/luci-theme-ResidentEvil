## [1.4.2] - 2026-09-23

## Changes in version 1.4.2

## Features

- **WebGL Fluid animation** (PR #85 — author: @frenzydrive)
  - Added a new login background option based on Pavel Dobryakov's WebGL Fluid Simulation (MIT license)
  - Available alongside the existing Canvas 2D particle modes; selectable in the theme settings
  - Lazy-loads `login-fluid.js` only when Fluid is chosen, so other modes pay no runtime cost
  - Falls back to the static background image if WebGL is unavailable or fails to initialize
  - Integrated with the smoothness fix so Fluid runs at full frame rate on capable devices

- **Configurable temperature thresholds** (PR #82 — author: @DoubleThePsycho)
  - Warm / Hot / Critical thresholds are now tunable instead of hardcoded 50 / 70 / 85 °C (defaults unchanged)
  - Stored in `proton2025.settings`, validated as whole numbers with `0 <= warm < hot < critical <= 150`
  - Compact controls at the bottom of Status → Realtime → Temperature with dirty-state Save and Reset-to-defaults
  - Badges, chart threshold lines and summaries update live after saving, no reload needed
  - Exposed via `luci.proton-temp` `getThresholds` / `setThresholds` as a shared source for the future dashboard widget

## Fixes

- **Login animation smoothness**
  - Restored smoother motion after the previous optimization had reduced the login background animation to a less fluid, overly throttled state

  - Kept a reduced-frame fallback for low-power devices, but raised the target frame rate for modern hardware to recover visual smoothness

  - Preserved the lightweight performance profile so weaker routers and older browsers still remain stable

  - Adjusted the animation timing logic to balance responsiveness with the original fluid visual feel

- **White flash on login page and on submit**
  - Added inline critical `background-color` style in `<head>` of `sysauth.ut` so the browser paints the correct dark/light background immediately, before external CSS loads

  - Eliminates the intermittent white flash of the login card when the Fluid animation is active and the user clicks login

  - Uses server-side `serverTheme` value so the inline style matches the resolved theme without waiting for JavaScript

  - On form submit the login page now dispatches a `proton-login-freeze` event that stops both Canvas 2D particles and WebGL Fluid loops, keeping the last frame and freeing the GPU for the next page paint

  - Covers keyboard/Enter/button submits plus a click backup for programmatic `form.submit()` (e.g. password-manager autofill), which skips the `submit` event

- **Port status cards with multiple networks** (fixes #81, #83)
  - Constrained multi-network zone color segments to the narrow status stripe instead of allowing them to overflow the port card

  - Stacked segments within the stripe on desktop hover and mobile layouts

- **Settings synchronization without HTTP ubus** (fixes #70 — reported and diagnosed by @ang3el7z)
  - Added `uhttpd-mod-ubus` as a runtime dependency and configure the standard `/ubus` endpoint during installation only when it is missing

  - Settings sync now checks HTTP status and response content type before parsing JSON, reporting a clear error instead of a misleading `Unexpected token "<"` message when a router returns an HTML 404 page

## Build

- **Theme asset versioning**
  - Increased the cache-busting asset version so updated UI scripts are reloaded by browsers after the animation adjustment

## Authors

- @ChesterGoodiny — smoothness restore, white flash fix, asset versioning

- @frenzydrive — WebGL Fluid animation (PR #85)

- @DoubleThePsycho — configurable temperature thresholds (PR #82)

- @ang3el7z — HTTP ubus gateway diagnosis and fix for settings synchronization (issue #70)

## Pull Requests

- #85 — Add WebGL fluid animation to login page

- #82 — Add configurable temperature thresholds

## [1.4.1] - 2026-09-07

## Changes in version 1.4.1

## Build

- **OpenWrt 25.12.5 package installation** (PR #79 — author: @fildunsky)
  - Fixed package installation and update failure on OpenWrt snapshot 25.12.5 and later

  - OpenWrt snapshots added `.ut` template precompilation to bytecode (format 0x02), which created incompatible bytecode that could not be loaded by the runtime

  - The `luci.mk` from snapshot-SDK was adding a dependency on `ucode (>=2026.02.27)`, but the bytecode format remained incompatible

  - Disabled template bytecode precompilation via build flag to ensure the package installs and updates correctly on all OpenWrt versions

---

## Authors

- @fildunsky — OpenWrt 25.12.5 installation fix

## Pull Requests

- #79 — Fix 1.4.x install/update on OpenWrt snapshot 25.12.5

## [1.4.0] - 2026-09-06

## Changes in version 1.4.0

## Features

- **Mobile navigation icons**
  - Replaced platform-dependent Unicode menu and close glyphs with consistent inline SVG icons

  - The menu trigger now switches between hamburger and close states while preserving accessibility labels and touch target

- **Mobile search layout**
  - Added a stable 44px search target that remains available without opening the menu

  - The focused search field expands into a separate header row without covering the mobile menu button

  - Preserved keyboard navigation, Escape handling, result roles and focus behavior

- **Wireless radio loading stability**
  - Added an atomic pending/ready phase for wireless radio classification

  - Prevented intermediate colored radio areas from flashing while LuCI builds the table

  - Limited reclassification to mutations that add or remove the Wireless container, table or radio rows; image `src` updates and internal cell redraws no longer restart classification

- **Selectable LuCI tab style**
  - Added the `modern` / `classic` / `proton` tab style setting with `modern` as the default

  - Classic mode restores an underline-based LuCI tab appearance without changing navigation or page URLs

  - Proton mode restores the earlier Proton tab design from the upstream repository, including the shared bottom rule, rounded tab tops and accent-highlighted active tab

  - The selected style is also applied to the tabs inside the Proton theme settings panel

  - Persisted the choice through localStorage and UCI, including early bootstrap, login synchronization, reset-to-defaults and localization

- **Desktop action dropdowns**
  - Network-page action menus now open on hover for mouse/trackpad users while retaining click behavior on touch devices

- **5G modem widget update** (PR #66 — author: @fildunsky)
  - Added support for a second modem when two modems are present in the system

## Fixes

- **Slower page loads**
  - `luci.js` was fetched twice per page: the theme header emitted its own tag, and LuCI core appends another one — about 30 KB of redundant transfer on every navigation

  - The theme tag is now `type="text/plain"`, so the browser neither downloads nor executes it, while `LuCI.__init__` still reads `?v=` from it

  - `xhr.js` is a 0-byte file in current LuCI builds and is no longer requested

  - `login-animation-settings.js` is now emitted only on System → Administration, the single page where its target block exists

  - `inter-cyrillic-ext.woff2` is no longer preloaded: fetched lazily via `unicode-range` with `font-display: swap` only when needed

  - Result: 5 network requests / 26 from cache instead of 22 full downloads

- **Floating notification drifting during page load**
  - `#maincontent` has a `fadeIn` animation with a `transform`, which made it the containing block for `position: fixed` notifications

  - Server-rendered floating alerts are now emitted before `#maincontainer`, so they are positioned against the viewport and stay put from the first frame

- **Mobile slide-out menu icons**
  - Section icons were sized only in the desktop media query, so on phones the SVG expanded to its viewBox (347×347px) and broke the menu layout

  - Menu rows are now 54px tall with 20×20px icons, and the label sits next to the icon instead of below it

- **Logout item in the collapsed side menu**
  - The collapsed-rail `margin` shorthand reset `margin-top: auto`, so "Logout" jumped up under the last section instead of staying pinned to the bottom

- **Text reflow while collapsing/expanding the side menu**
  - Menu labels wrapped on every frame of the 72↔240px width animation

  - Labels are now single-line with ellipsis clipping

- **Top menu flashing for a second on the first login**
  - The menu layout was read only from `localStorage`, which a fresh browser does not have yet

  - `header.ut` now reads `menu_mode`/`menu_collapsed` from UCI over ubus server-side and embeds them into the pre-paint inline script

  - Result: 3 ms instead of 1261 ms, with no relocation afterwards

- **Dark strip drawn over the page content during load in side-menu mode**
  - The server renders `#mainmenu` empty inside the header, and `menu-proton2025.js` relocates it only after `ui.menu.load()` resolves

  - `header.ut` now relocates the column at parse time: an inline script moves `#mainmenu` while the HTML is still streaming

  - `#maincontainer > #mainmenu:empty` keeps the normal width so `#maincontent` never reflows when the items appear

- **/admin/status/ rendered with unstyled tables**
  - Both `/admin/status/` and `/admin/status/overview` serve the same Overview view, but the theme derived the page identifier from `ctx.request_path` instead of `ctx.path`

  - `header.ut` now uses `ctx.path` for both the per-page `<link>` list and `body[data-page]`

  - Verified: `/admin/status/`, `/admin/` and `/admin/status/overview` now all emit `cascade-overview.css` + `cascade-status.css`

- **Login page in light theme**
  - The password eye button rendered as a solid accent-filled circle with a glow

  - The accent gradient was painted twice (on `body` and again on the particles layer above it)

  - Raised contrast of the card, inputs and labels, replaced accent-tinted borders with neutral ones, and restored the card border on narrow screens

- **Mobile login page** (fixes #63)
  - Restored the rounded card corners and softened the shadow while keeping the glassmorphism effect

- **Pending changes indicator** (fixes #69)
  - Header indicators are now compact icon badges with a counter instead of long text labels

  - "Unsaved changes" indicator is no longer clipped

- **Processes page table** (fixes #73)
  - The Actions column with three long buttons no longer overflows the table: buttons wrap and use compact padding

- **luci-app-filemanager dark mode** (fixes #72)
  - Header and status bars in `luci-app-filemanager` now follow the Proton dark theme

  - Text boxes no longer render white text on a white background

- **Port status card tooltip** (fixes #30)
  - The interface tooltip on hover is now anchored inside the card and clamped to the viewport width, so it is no longer clipped

- **Mobile text overflow** (fixes #30)
  - Long values (versions, package names, MAC/IP addresses) now wrap instead of overflowing their cells on narrow screens

- **Temperature graph** (fixes #30)
  - Sensor labels with close temperatures no longer overlap each other

- **Package Manager progress bar**
  - The storage usage label no longer gets clipped on narrow bars: a short adaptive summary is shown, the full text stays in the tooltip

- **Package Manager table header** (fixes #6)
  - The title row now renders as one consistent header with a single font instead of inheriting per-column data-cell styles

- **Chinese localization** (fixes #6)
  - Completed the `zh` dictionary for the theme settings panel; all 9 locales now fully translated

- **Dropdown corners** (fixes #6)
  - `select` and `.cbi-dropdown` now use the theme radius variable, including the open list

- **OpenClash dropdowns** (refs #61)
  - Long option labels no longer overflow the dropdown: items wrap and the list width adapts

- **Theme asset caching**
  - Added a version query to theme CSS/JS and `luci.js` so browsers pick up updated files after a theme upgrade without a manual cache reset

- **Tab strip baseline** (PR #68 — author: @fildunsky)
  - Reduced the gap between tab baseline and page content from 24px to 12px so the line reads as the tabs' baseline

- **Progress bar** (PR #67 — author: @fildunsky)
  - Improved progress bar track tint for better visual consistency

## Changed

- Swapped the CBI button styles: "Apply" is now the solid accent button, "Save" is neutral

- Increased the default page width from 990px to 1200px

- Redesigned the "Port status" cards on the Overview page (zone stripe, LED status indicator, compact traffic row)

- Reworked the theme settings panel into a tabbed card inside the LuCI section

- Removed the "Wrap table text" and "Modem temperature" options

- Separated notifications from dialogs: LuCI core reuses `.alert-message` inside modals (session expiry, Save & Apply, rollback), so those are no longer treated as floating notifications

- Alerts inside `#modal_overlay` no longer render their own card (background, blur, shadow) on top of the dialog

- `displayStatus()` modals lost the phantom 18px indent from the inherited flex layout and accent stripe

- Managed floating alerts drop the duplicate core "Dismiss" button and keep the compact close control

- Added styling for the core `notice` and `error` alert types and for `.btn.primary` in dialogs

- Empty `<h4>` headings in `showModal('', '')` dialogs no longer draw a bare divider line

- Inline system alerts now actually disappear when dismissed: the theme styled `.fade-out` so the core `transitionend` remover now fires

- Moved the theme's own toasts onto the shared floating notification surface

- Every migrated toast now carries a context heading (`Login Page Animation` for the animation switch, `Custom login branding` for the logo controls)

- The two "logo is too large" guards are now `warning` cards rather than looking like successful saves

- Notifications may opt into auto-closing with `data-proton-timeout`; auto-closed cards are not remembered in `sessionStorage`

- The keyboard shortcut echo in the log viewer keeps its own compact look but now reads its styling from the theme tokens instead of inline styles

## Features

- **Background patterns customization** (PR #51 — author: @fildunsky)
  - Added background pattern option with three test patterns

  - Added a slider to adjust pattern scale

  - Changed "noise" effect to "stars" — they regenerate differently each time the scale is changed

  - Moved hardcoded design values (light pattern colors, grid/dots/noise sizes, SVG noise alpha, card RGB) to CSS variables (`--proton-pattern-grid-size`, `--proton-pattern-dots-size`, `--proton-pattern-light-line`, `--proton-pattern-light-dot`, `--proton-pattern-noise-size`)

## Fixes

- **Initial account transparency** (author: @ChesterGoodiny)
  - Fixed a bug that caused the authorization card to become transparent for a short time when displaying the first page

  - The animation of the login container `fadeInUp` was replaced with `loginSlideIn`

  - Opacity animation has been removed from the login effect

  - The login card is now visible from the first frame, while maintaining a short slide transition

  - This prevents the animated background from being visible in the authorization window for a split second

- **Translation of the login logo** (author: @ChesterGoodiny)
  - The hard-coded EN/RU translation pairs have been removed from `login-animation-settings.js`

## Features

- **Optional tab outline setting** (PR #45 - author: @fildunsky)
  - Added an optional `Tab outline` setting

  - The option is disabled by default and can be enabled to outline inactive tabs

## Fixes

- **Temperature sensor detection rework** (commit 1dbc96e - author: @ChesterGoodiny)
  - Reworked the temperature detection logic after the previous temperature fix

  - Detection now prefers `/sys/class/hwmon` sensors and adds `/sys/class/thermal` sensors only when they are not already represented by `hwmon`

  - CPU/SoC sensors are no longer duplicated when exposed both through `thermal_zone` and `hwmon`

  - Wi-Fi radio sensors, including `mt7915_phy0` and `mt7915_phy1`, are no longer hidden when their temperatures are identical or close

  - Removed temperature-value based deduplication in favor of stable sysfs path/device identity checks

- **Visual and layout fixes** (PR #45 - author: @fildunsky)
  - Aligned Network → Interfaces icons and device names inside interface cards

  - Improved bridge-member icon alignment inside brackets

  - Fixed Status → Overview active DHCP leases table layout so long hostnames wrap without stretching the table

  - Kept IPv4, MAC and lease-time values on one line while allowing the hostname column to wrap

  - Fixed action column width and overflow in 5-column and 7-column lease table variants

  - Improved Network → Interfaces mobile action buttons: Edit is blue, Delete is red

  - Fixed white button-block background in the light theme on mobile

  - Fixed Software page table styling, hover behavior and colored button hover states

  - Fixed port status card headers overflowing rounded corners

  - Fixed GitHub stars display in `README.md`

  - Fixed GitHub stars display in `README_ru.md`

- **Modal table overflow** (PR #47 - author: @frenzydrive)
  - Fixed wide LuCI CBI tables overflowing outside modal dialogs

  - Modal dialogs containing CBI tables now adapt to the available viewport width

  - Table overflow stays inside the modal and becomes horizontally scrollable when needed

  - Row action buttons in modal tables stay on one line

  - The issue was visible, for example, in WireGuard/AmneziaWG peer tables under Network → Interfaces

## Build

- **OpenWrt SDK version update** (PR #47 - author: @frenzydrive)
  - Updated the OpenWrt snapshot SDK reference used by the build workflow

  - Updated APK build workflow SDK from `gcc-14.3.0` to `gcc-14.4.0`

## Notes

- The final v1.2.8 temperature detection behavior prefers `hwmon` first and adds `thermal_zone` sensors only when they are not already represented by `hwmon`.

- Verified with `ubus call luci.proton-temp getSensors '{}'`: CPU and both MT7915 PHY sensors are detected correctly without duplicates.

## Build

- **Legacy csstidy minifier skipped** (PR #41 — author: @fildunsky)
  - Skipped the legacy `csstidy` minifier — it only understands the CSS 3.0 draft and floods the build log with "Invalid property" warnings for every modern rule (custom properties, gap, transform, grid, backdrop-filter, etc.)

  - Prevents potential corruption of `calc()` and custom property values

  - Stylesheet is now shipped as-is; JS/Lua minification remains unaffected

## [1.2.4] - 2026-06-10

# Changes in version 1.2.4

## Fixes

- **Navigation panel width jumping** — fixed issue where panel changed width before and after page load
  - ~~Changes from PR #32 (fildunsky): default width from `990px` to `80%`~~ — reverted, caused interface jumping

  - Restored stable value `--proton-page-max-width: 990px`

  - Added `!important` flag for inline styles — prevents override from cascade.css

  - Width is now set once on load and no longer changes

  - **Note:** Users can adjust width via "Page Width" slider in theme settings (e.g., set to 80% if needed)

- **Login page with changed zoom** (PR #33 — author: [@frenzydrive](https://github.com/frenzydrive))

  - Another browser/device can now see the latest theme settings on the login page before authentication

  - Improved cross-device behavior

- **Login Animation Selector** - Fixed missing login animation option that could fail to appear in theme settings

- **Form Persistence** - Fixed Proton2025 settings block disappearing after Save/Apply on system settings pages:

## [1.2.0] - 2026-05-30

## Proton2025 Theme v1.2.0

## New Features

- **Header search** - Added a built-in search bar that indexes LuCI pages for semantic matching, keyboard-layout/transliteration tolerance, and quick navigation across pages and settings.

- **Package Architecture widget** - Added a package/feed architecture badge on Status -> Overview. The badge shows the router package architecture and opens the detected package feed URL when available.

- **Realtime Temperature page** - Added a dedicated Status -> Realtime Graphs -> Temperature page with live sensor history, per-sensor focus, multi-sensor overview, mobile-friendly layout, and hover details on the chart.

## Improvements

- **Mobile layout improvements** - Reworked the page for small screens, including responsive sensor chips, stacked summary cards, and a mobile-friendly sensor statistics layout.

- **Notification system hardening** - Added theme-managed floating alerts with close controls and responsive styling, split them from native LuCI warnings, preserved original button handlers during alert normalization, and restored the password warning correctly after re-login.

- **Wireless mobile actions menu** - Fixed clipping of the three-dot actions dropdown on small screens by opening it upward when there is not enough space below the toggle.

- **Global Name column fix** - Restored LuCI named-table rendering for the first `Name` / `Название` column across services and other CBI tables that use `data-title` pseudo-cells instead of real header cells.

- **Theme consistency fixes** - Improved light theme rendering for chart tooltips and removed inconsistent hostname hover coloring.

- **Internal view naming cleanup** - Renamed the realtime temperature view file to a Proton-specific path to avoid conflicts with third-party LuCI packages.

## [1.1.2] - 2026-04-12

# Changelog v1.1.2

## Bug Fixes

- **Login Page** — Fixed login page localization by replacing `{{ _('Login') }}` with the standard LuCI string `{{ _('Log in') }}`, allowing the correct translation to load.

- **Dynamic List Fields** — Fixed horizontal overflow in LuCI dynamic list widgets (`.cbi-dynlist`) so long values now wrap correctly instead of stretching the form layout. Thanks to `@DrStorey` for the report and the original CSS override example.

- **Light Theme Transparency** — Fixed light mode transparency by correcting the header selector and using a denser top bar background for better readability.

- **Mobile Sidebar Shadow** — Removed the unwanted edge darkening caused by the hidden mobile sidebar in both light and dark themes, while keeping a softer shadow when the menu is open.

- **Firewall Rules Table** — Restored the missing `Name` column on the Firewall → Traffic Rules page by re-enabling the LuCI pseudo-column rendered from each row’s `data-title` attribute.

- **Language & Style Layout** — Updated the Proton2025 settings insertion logic so the built-in `Table Filters` option stays in its native position on newer LuCI versions, while older LuCI builds without that option keep the previous layout.

- **APK Package Build** — Reworked the CI packaging flow so `.apk` releases are built by the official OpenWrt SDK instead of being manually repacked as `tar.gz`, fixed artifact detection for the native APK filename format used by OpenWrt, and aligned CI versioning between APK and IPK packages. Thanks to `@inteliboy` for the original report, `@RoVRy` for confirming the issue on newer OpenWrt builds, and `@fildunsky` for sharing a working APK build example.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-03-04

# Changelog v1.1.1

## Bug Fixes

- **Backup/Restore buttons on mobile** — Fixed overlapping buttons on screens ≤600px; buttons now stack vertically and span full width

- **Port Status cards (Overview)** — Reduced card min-width for better fit on medium screens; cards wrap earlier without overflow

- **Reboot confirmation modal — single language** — Fixed `tr()` helper using wrong variable; modal now correctly translates to all 10 supported languages

- **MTK WiFi icons (issue #11)** — Fixed `remapIcon()` failing for proprietary MTK device names, added 3-level detection: ① `data-radio-device` attribute, ② exact badge text match, ③ substring search; fixed MutationObserver race condition

- **Background gradient flash (FOUC)** — Fixed brief flash of default gradient on reload/navigation; inline `<head>` script now sets `--proton-accent-rgb` and critical inline CSS includes the full body gradient for both themes

- **Mobile burger menu tap highlight** — Fixed browser-default tap highlight color on mobile; added `-webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent` and proper `:active` states

## Refactoring

- **Wireless frequency pipeline** — Replaced regex-based text parsing and per-frequency CSS hardcode with server-side ubus data pipeline (`network.wireless status` → `header.ut` → `data-band` attribute → CSS); JS sets only structural `data-band="2g|5g|6g|60g"`, CSS defines all colors via `tr[data-band]` selectors; works with any device names; reduced ~90 lines of hardcoded CSS to ~30 universal lines

- **Removed duplicate MutationObserver** — `markRadioDevicesAndFreq()` now runs only from `header.ut` inline observer; removed redundant calls from `menu-proton2025.js` (was triggering twice per mutation)

- **Cleaned dead code** — Removed `isWirelessDevice()` regex fallback (`/^radio\d+$/`), `BAND_COLORS` JS object, `applyFreqStyle()`, and 3 `window._proton*` exports that are no longer needed

  - New RPC module `luci.proton-settings` for managing settings

  - Automatic synchronization when switching browser tabs

### Technical Details: Settings Synchronization

**New Files:**

- `/etc/config/proton2025` — UCI configuration file for theme settings

- `/usr/share/rpcd/ucode/luci.proton-settings` — RPC module for reading/writing settings

- `/www/luci-static/proton2025/settings-sync.js` — JavaScript synchronization module

**Supported Settings:**

| Setting | UCI Option | Values |

|--------|------------|--------|

| Theme Mode | `mode` | `dark`, `light` |

| Accent Color | `accent` | `default`, `blue`, `purple`, `green`, `orange`, `red` |

| Zoom Level | `zoom` | `50`–`150` |

| Transparency | `transparency` | `0`, `1` |

| Border Radius | `border_radius` | `default`, `sharp`, `extra` |

| Animations | `animations` | `0`, `1` |

| Services Widget | `services_widget` | `0`, `1` |

| Temperature Widget | `temp_widget` | `0`, `1` |

| Services Log | `services_log` | `0`, `1` |

| Table Text Wrap | `table_wrap` | `0`, `1` |

**Synchronization Logic:**

```plaintext

Page Load:

1. [sync]   localStorage → apply instantly (no flicker)

2. [async]  UCI → compare → update localStorage if different



Setting Change:

1. [sync]   localStorage → apply instantly

2. [async]  UCI → save (debounced, 500ms delay)

```
